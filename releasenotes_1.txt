Release 1 comments:

1. Revisions to project proposal (25/25):
	- Proposal approved
	- Since the SUT has multiple commits, I suggest an analysis of the 	repository commits and generate statistics using gitstats or gitinspector.
	- See project proposal documents for additonal comments, if any.


2. Software Inspection (30/30):
	- Compliance to software inspection process (10)
	- Inspection logs (20)
		* This is good for now. For the final release, you should perform an analysis on these defects and summarize/interpret the results, including comparisons to results from the static analyzer. (See Section 9 of "Static Analysis - Process Description" on Blackboard for summary of "Measurements". It will be useful to report these metrics). 

3. Release notes (5/5)

Release #1

Updates to Project Goals - 
1. We have decided to consider the following modules - Dashboard, Tasks, Leads and Users.
2. In the next release we will analyze the code using a tool and the results will be further analyzed to determine any correlation with results from manual inspection.
These changes can be found in the Software Testing part of the proposal.

Manual Inspection - 
We have performed manual inspection on the above stated modules and reports are created using spreadsheets. 
Reports are created in manual_testing_reports.xls
